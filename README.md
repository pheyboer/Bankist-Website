# Bankist Website | A Virtual Bank

The Bankist Website is a dynamic, visually appealing, and user-friendly banking website built with modern JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project is designed to simulate a front-end banking experience, focusing on advanced DOM manipulation, animations, and interactive elements. 

The website is aimed at mastering the implementation of smooth scrolling, sticky navigation, dynamic content rendering, and user interactions within a single-page application.

## Features
- Smooth Scrolling: A smooth scroll experience across the page for better navigation.
- Sticky Navigation Bar: The navigation bar stays fixed at the top as users scroll.
- Dynamic Testimonial Slider: A testimonial section with smooth transitions to display feedback.
- Tabbed Interface: Allows users to interact with different banking operations such as viewing balances, transferring money, etc.
