# Bankist Website | A Virtual Bank

Bankist is a simulated virtual banking application built as part of the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/): The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. This project is a frontend-focused exercise aimed at mastering advanced DOM manipulation techniques in JavaScript.

## Overview
The Bankist application consists of two key pages:

- Home Page (index.html): A dynamic single-page layout containing multiple sections like:
  - Hero section
  - Services and features overview
  - User testimonial section
  - App Page: Accessible after the user "logs in" on the home page. This page allows the user to:

View account balances
Transfer money between accounts
Request loans
Review recent transactions

## Features
- Smooth Scrolling: A smooth scroll experience across the page for better navigation.
- Sticky Navigation Bar: The navigation bar stays fixed at the top as users scroll.
- Dynamic Testimonial Slider: A testimonial section with smooth transitions to display feedback.
